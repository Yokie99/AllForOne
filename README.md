All for One - created a website using all the mini challenge endpoints
Peer Reviewer: Elizabeth Trotter
Review: The project is off to a great start. The design is clean and looks nice! The web application needs just a little more work with the responsiveness, but overall great work.


// Finished: A working desktop site that is able to access all endpoints
// To work on: 
    + Mobile responsivness 
    + adding if statements so endpoints cent be accessed unless all input fields are filled out, 
    + some of the number based end points are missing a tryparse statement to only accept numbers, 
    + styling of the button to include the colors desired to match figma prototype
    +
